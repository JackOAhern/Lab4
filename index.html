          <h2>UX Design</h2>
          <p>User experience design (UX Design) is the process of creating
            evidence-based, interaction designs between human users and products/websites.
            Design decisions in UX design are driven by research, data analysis,
            and test results rather than aesthetic preferences and opinions
          </p>
          <h2>Data Science</h2>
          <p>Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes,
            algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy,
            structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable
            insights from data across a broad range of application domains.

        <h2>Importance of Accesible Design</h2>
        <p>Accesible design can benefit everyone who interacts with your material
          and can save you time and effort in the future while benefiting
          the largest number of people in the present. It is important to think
          about how everyone will be able to interact with your designs and allow
          users with disabilities to access all relevant information.</p>
